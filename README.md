The technology isn't about gadgets or hype. To design and build is human. I see **Engineering** as the *ultimate form of art*.

:shipit: I've been in **Dev**. I've been in **Ops**. I've been in **QA**.<br>
:skull: Then I was hurt and I was lost. There was no meaning in my life.<br>
:wrench: I learned how to make things. Because curiosity was all I had left.<br>
:snake: Then I've started teaching **Python for Scientific Computing** at University.<br>
:zap: Then I had discovered a paradigm shift in Internet technology. It felt like... *future*.<br>
:cloud: Now I'm ascending into the Cloud.<br>

We have the tools. Let's build the future!
