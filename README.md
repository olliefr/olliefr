I'm a principal-level multi-skilled freelancer. I can troubleshoot and fix almost any system, whatever it takes 😈 

My current interests are cloud-native systems, data lakehouses, data analytics, and machine learning. I study new tech and practice my craft every day. For an up-to-date list of buzzwords, check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ofr/).

My *smol* tech consultancy [Devil Mice Labs](https://devilmicelabs.com/) is vendor-neutral and truly client-oriented `<:3)~`

### Shiny Trinkets

I am quite extensively [certified in Google Cloud](https://www.credly.com/users/oliver-frolovs) and a few other adjacent technologies ☺️
