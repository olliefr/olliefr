## About me

I'm the founder of [Devil Mice Labs](https://devilmicelabs.com/), a Cloud-native tech consultancy.

My current interests are **machine learning** and **Cloud computing**. I'm very hands-on and I love to learn new things and to push the boundaries of what technology can do for us. I study and practice every single day. Tech is my life ❤️
